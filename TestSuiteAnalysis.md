## Fix: Deals Search API Route Conflict (2025-03-19) - Updated

### Problem
The system was encountering UUID validation errors when trying to access the `/api/v1/deals/search` endpoint via GET request. The error occurred because the system was trying to interpret "search" as a UUID due to a routing conflict with the `/{deal_id}` route.

Error message:
```
Unexpected error in database session: [{'type': 'uuid_parsing', 'loc': ('path', 'deal_id'), 'msg': 'Input should be a valid UUID, invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found `s` at 1', 'input': 'search'}]
```

### Initial Solution
1. Added a GET endpoint for `/search` to handle GET requests
   - Created a new `search_deals_get` handler that accepts query parameters
   - Converted these parameters to a DealSearch model
   - Reused the existing POST endpoint handler to maintain consistent behavior

2. Keep the existing POST endpoint for cases where the search criteria is provided in the request body

### Enhanced Solution
The initial fix didn't completely resolve the issue because FastAPI routes are matched in order of declaration. The route order needed to be adjusted:

1. Moved both the `/search` GET and POST endpoint declarations above the `/{deal_id}` route
   - This ensures the more specific `/search` route is matched before the general `/{deal_id}` route
   - When specific routes come after pattern routes, they can be unreachable

2. Ensured the search functionality remained identical between GET and POST methods

### Files Affected
- `backend/core/api/v1/deals/router.py`
   - Added new GET route for `/search`
   - Moved both search endpoints to be declared before the `/{deal_id}` route
   - Implemented handler to support query parameters for search

## Fix: Deal Creation with Zero Price (2025-03-20)

### Problem
The system was encountering database constraint violations when trying to insert deals with a price of 0.00, as there is a check constraint `ch_positive_price` on the deals table that requires prices to be greater than 0.

Error message:
```
new row for relation "deals" violates check constraint "ch_positive_price"
```

### Solution
1. Updated `_create_deal_from_scraped_data` method to validate and ensure prices are always positive before insertion
   - Added validation to convert any price to a Decimal if not already
   - Set a minimum price of 0.01 if the price is 0 or negative
   - Added proper error handling for invalid price formats

2. Modified `create_deal` method to use a default price of 0.01 instead of 0.00
   - Changed the default parameter from `Decimal('0.00')` to `Decimal('0.01')`

3. Updated the `_perform_realtime_scraping` method to ensure minimum price
   - Modified price extraction to use `max(price, 0.01)` to ensure we never have zero prices

### Files Affected
- `backend/core/services/deal.py`
   - Updated default price in `create_deal` method
   - Added price validation in `_create_deal_from_scraped_data` method
   - Modified price handling in `_perform_realtime_scraping` method
   - Added import for `InvalidOperation` from `decimal` module

## Fix: Search Functionality Issues (2025-03-20)

### Problem
On the deals dashboard, the search feature was sending requests to the backend on every keystroke, causing unnecessary load and potential rate-limiting issues.

### Solution
1. Modified the search behavior to only trigger when:
   - User presses Enter in the search input
   - User clicks the search button

2. Implemented a two-state approach:
   - `pendingSearchQuery`: What the user is typing (updated on each keystroke)
   - `searchQuery`: The actual query sent to the backend (updated only on submit)

3. Added a search button with proper styling consistent with the UI design

### Files Affected
- `frontend/src/components/Deals/DealsList.tsx`
   - Added `pendingSearchQuery` state to track input value
   - Added form submission handling
   - Implemented Enter key handling
   - Added search button with loading indicator
