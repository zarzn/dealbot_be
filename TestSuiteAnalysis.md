# Test Suite Analysis and Fixes

This document tracks issues identified during testing and their corresponding fixes.

## Fix: Deals Search API Route Conflict (2025-03-19) - Updated

### Problem
The system was encountering UUID validation errors when trying to access the `/api/v1/deals/search` endpoint via GET request. The error occurred because the system was trying to interpret "search" as a UUID due to a routing conflict with the `/{deal_id}` route.

Error message:
```
Unexpected error in database session: [{'type': 'uuid_parsing', 'loc': ('path', 'deal_id'), 'msg': 'Input should be a valid UUID, invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found `s` at 1', 'input': 'search'}]
```

### Initial Solution
1. Added a GET endpoint for `/search` to handle GET requests
   - Created a new `search_deals_get` handler that accepts query parameters
   - Converted these parameters to a DealSearch model
   - Reused the existing POST endpoint handler to maintain consistent behavior

2. Keep the existing POST endpoint for cases where the search criteria is provided in the request body

### Enhanced Solution
The initial fix didn't completely resolve the issue because FastAPI routes are matched in order of declaration. The route order needed to be adjusted:

1. Moved both the `/search` GET and POST endpoint declarations above the `/{deal_id}` route
   - This ensures the more specific `/search` route is matched before the general `/{deal_id}` route
   - When specific routes come after pattern routes, they can be unreachable

2. Ensured the search functionality remained identical between GET and POST methods

### Files Affected
- `backend/core/api/v1/deals/router.py`
   - Added new GET route for `/search`
   - Moved both search endpoints to be declared before the `/{deal_id}` route
   - Implemented handler to support query parameters for search

## Fix: Deal Creation with Zero Price (2025-03-20)

### Problem
The system was encountering database constraint violations when trying to insert deals with a price of 0.00, as there is a check constraint `ch_positive_price` on the deals table that requires prices to be greater than 0.

Error message:
```
new row for relation "deals" violates check constraint "ch_positive_price"
```

### Solution
1. Updated `_create_deal_from_scraped_data` method to validate and ensure prices are always positive before insertion
   - Added validation to convert any price to a Decimal if not already
   - Set a minimum price of 0.01 if the price is 0 or negative
   - Added proper error handling for invalid price formats

2. Modified `create_deal` method to use a default price of 0.01 instead of 0.00
   - Changed the default parameter from `Decimal('0.00')` to `Decimal('0.01')`

3. Updated the `_perform_realtime_scraping` method to ensure minimum price
   - Modified price extraction to use `max(price, 0.01)` to ensure we never have zero prices

### Files Affected
- `backend/core/services/deal.py`
   - Updated default price in `create_deal` method
   - Added price validation in `_create_deal_from_scraped_data` method
   - Modified price handling in `_perform_realtime_scraping` method
   - Added import for `InvalidOperation` from `decimal` module

## Fix: Search Functionality Issues (2025-03-20)

### Problem
On the deals dashboard, the search feature was sending requests to the backend on every keystroke, causing unnecessary load and potential rate-limiting issues.

### Solution
1. Modified the search behavior to only trigger when:
   - User presses Enter in the search input
   - User clicks the search button

2. Implemented a two-state approach:
   - `pendingSearchQuery`: What the user is typing (updated on each keystroke)
   - `searchQuery`: The actual query sent to the backend (updated only on submit)

3. Added a search button with proper styling consistent with the UI design

### Files Affected
- `frontend/src/components/Deals/DealsList.tsx`
   - Added `pendingSearchQuery` state to track input value
   - Added form submission handling
   - Implemented Enter key handling
   - Added search button with loading indicator

## Fix: Google Shopping Integration and Circular Import Issues (2025-03-23)

### Problem
The system was encountering multiple issues with the Google Shopping integration:

1. Circular import problem between `market_search.py`, `market_factory.py`, and `scraper_api.py`
2. Missing function implementation for `get_scraper_api` in `scraper_api.py`
3. Invalid syntax issues in the `GoogleShoppingIntegration` class error handling
4. Syntax error in the `promotion.py` file with the conditional unpacking of metadata dictionaries

Error messages:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_user_service' from 'core.services.user'
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_notification_service' from 'core.services.notification'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax - **metadata if metadata else {}
No name 'get_scraper_api' in module 'core.integrations.scraper_api'
```

### Solution
1. **Fixed Circular Import Issue**:
   - Modified `market_factory.py` to use lazy imports for `ScraperAPIService`
   - Added a `get_scraper_api_service` method to the `MarketIntegrationFactory` class that lazy-loads the service

2. **Implemented Missing Functions**:

   - Standardized error messages across all market integration classes
   - Fixed variable names and return types in the `google_shopping.py` implementation

4. **Fixed Syntax Error in Promotion Service**:
   - Replaced invalid syntax `**metadata if metadata else {}` with the proper Python syntax `**(metadata or {})`
   - Applied the fix to all occurrences in the file

### Files Affected
- `backend/core/integrations/market_factory.py`: Modified to implement lazy loading of dependencies
- `backend/core/integrations/scraper_api.py`: Added `get_scraper_api` function implementation
- `backend/core/integrations/google_shopping.py`: Fixed error handling and parameter standardization
- `backend/core/services/promotion.py`: Fixed invalid syntax for dictionary unpacking

### Remarks
These fixes have successfully resolved the circular import issues and syntax errors, allowing the Google Shopping integration to function properly. The application can now start without errors and handle Google Shopping searches and product details retrieval. The implemented solution follows best practices for avoiding circular dependencies in Python modules. 

## Fix: AI Functionality Separation for Search (2025-03-21)

### Problem
The system was not properly distinguishing between different AI functionalities in the search process, which led to irrelevant search results when AI batch analysis was disabled. The core issue was that AI query parsing (an essential feature for improving search relevance) was incorrectly being disabled along with AI batch analysis.

### Solution
Implemented a clear separation of AI functionality into three distinct components:

1. **AI Query Parsing (ALWAYS ENABLED)**:
   - This is a core feature that extracts meaningful terms, categories, price ranges, brands, etc. from the user's search query
   - Significantly improves search relevance by understanding what the user is actually looking for
   - Must always remain enabled, regardless of the `perform_ai_analysis` parameter value
   - Example: Extracting "projector LED under $500" from "find me a projector LED under $500"

2. **AI Query Enhancement for Filtering (ALWAYS ENABLED)**:
   - Uses the parsed query data to enhance database queries and market search parameters
   - Applies AI-suggested categories, price ranges, brands, etc. to filter results
   - This functionality is essential for the core search feature and remains enabled

3. **AI Batch Analysis and Scoring (CONTROLLED)**:
   - Performs additional analysis on search results after they're returned from the database/scraper
   - Calculates relevance scores, adds recommendations, etc.
   - This is controlled by the `perform_ai_analysis` parameter
   - Disabled by default to improve performance for most searches

### Implementation Details
1. Updated `search_deals` method to always perform AI query parsing regardless of the `perform_ai_analysis` parameter:
   - Modified the method to always call `ai_service.analyze_search_query`
   - Added clear documentation explaining that query parsing is always enabled

2. Modified `_perform_realtime_scraping` method to:
   - Always apply AI-derived filtering parameters if available (brands, categories, price ranges)
   - Only perform batch AI analysis when explicitly requested via `perform_ai_analysis=True`
   - Add clear logging to distinguish between the different AI functions

3. Updated the API router documentation to clarify the functionality separation:
   - Added explicit comments explaining that query parsing is always enabled
   - Clarified that the `perform_ai_analysis` parameter only controls batch analysis

### Files Affected
- `backend/core/services/deal.py`
   - Updated `search_deals` method to always perform AI query parsing
   - Modified `_perform_realtime_scraping` to properly separate the functions
   - Improved logging to clarify which functionality is being used

- `backend/core/api/v1/deals/router.py`
   - Added clarifying comments about AI functionality separation
   - Updated documentation for the search endpoint to explain the tiered AI approach

### Results
- Search functionality now correctly uses AI query parsing for all searches
- Better relevance for search results, even when batch analysis is disabled
- Clearer separation of concerns in the code for maintainability
- Improved performance by making batch analysis optional while keeping essential AI features 

## Fix: Improved Product Filtering and Fallback Mechanism (2025-03-23)

### Problem
The product post-filtering logic was too strict, resulting in all products being filtered out in many search scenarios. In addition, the fallback mechanism was limited to only showing 5 products regardless of the total available, which didn't provide enough options to users when strict filtering failed.

### Solution
1. **Enhanced Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Modified the fallback to dynamically calculate the number of products to show (now 10-20 or 20% of total)
   - Added logging of the minimum relevance score threshold for better debugging
   - Implemented an additional mechanism to supplement results when few products pass filtering
   - Improved product scoring to retain more context about relevance

2. **Improved Non-AI Filtering Logic**:
   - Replaced exact string matching with flexible term matching for better keyword recognition
   - Added specific handling for feature requirements to ensure they're properly considered
   - Implemented title-specific bonuses to prioritize products with matches in titles
   - Added category matching as a fallback when keyword matching fails
   - Changed the approach to keep products with lower scores rather than excluding them entirely

3. **Adaptive Filtering Approach**:
   - The system now builds a comprehensive ranking of products based on relevance
   - Even when strict criteria aren't met, products remain in consideration for the fallback mechanism
   - Enhanced the scoring system to better reflect the actual relevance to the search query

### Implementation Details
1. Modified the fallback mechanism in `_perform_realtime_scraping` method to:
   - Take up to 20% of available products or at least 10 (up from fixed 5)
   - Add a secondary fallback that triggers when fewer than 5 products pass filtering
   - Log detailed information about relevance scores and thresholds

2. Enhanced the non-AI filtering in `_perform_realtime_scraping` to:
   - Use the same `flexible_term_match` function used in AI-enhanced filtering
   - Provide special handling for feature requirements
   - Include category-based matching when keyword matching fails
   - Add bonus points for title matches to improve result ranking

### Files Affected
- `backend/core/services/deal.py`
   - Updated the fallback mechanism to be more adaptive
   - Enhanced the non-AI filtering logic for better matching
   - Implemented more nuanced scoring mechanisms

### Results
- Search results are now more comprehensive even when strict criteria aren't met
- Users see more relevant products in search results
- Better ranking of products based on relevance to the search query
- Improved debug information for understanding filtering decisions
- More adaptive filtering that scales with the number of available products
