# Script Organization Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated Duplicate Files**:
   - Combined `setup_db.py` and `setup_db_local.py` into a single `setup_db.py` script that supports both Docker and local environments
   - Removed the original duplicate files

2. **Organized Scripts by Function**:
   - Created a structured directory hierarchy
   - Moved scripts to appropriate subdirectories based on their function

3. **Created Documentation**:
   - Added README.md files to each directory explaining the scripts and their usage
   - Created this summary document

## New Directory Structure

## Benefits of New Organization

1. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Scripts are logically grouped by function
   - Easier to find specific scripts
   - Reduced duplication

2. **Better Documentation**:
   - Each directory has its own README.md
   - Clear usage instructions
   - Consistent documentation format

3. **Cleaner Root Directory**:
   - Removed clutter from the root directory
   - Organized structure makes it easier to navigate

4. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Development scripts are separate from deployment scripts
   - Debug scripts are isolated from production code
   - Test scripts are in their own directory

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Database Operations**:
   - Use `dev/db/setup_db.py` for database setup
   - Use `--local` flag for local environment

2. **Running Tests**:
   - Use `dev/test/run_consolidated_tests.ps1` for running all tests

3. **Debugging**:
   - Use scripts in `dev/debug/` for debugging purposes
   - These scripts should not be used in production

4. **Deployment**:
   - Use scripts in `deployment/` for deployment operations
   - Make sure to set executable permissions on shell scripts
