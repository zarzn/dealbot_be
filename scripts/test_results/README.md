# Test Results Directory

This directory contains the results of test runs generated by the test scripts.

## Contents

- `summary.txt`: Summary of the most recent test run
- Test reports in various formats (HTML, XML, etc.)
- Test coverage reports
- Test logs

## Usage

This directory is automatically used by the test scripts in `backend/scripts/dev/test/` to store test results. You typically don't need to interact with this directory directly.

The test scripts will generate and update files in this directory when they are run.

## Notes

- This directory is used for storing test results only and should not contain any executable scripts
- Test results are useful for debugging and monitoring test coverage
- The contents of this directory may be cleared periodically to save disk space
- Important test results should be backed up before clearing this directory
