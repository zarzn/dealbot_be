# PriceHistory Model Fix Report
Date: February 26, 2025

## Issue Type: Database Schema and ORM Model Mismatch

## Issues Identified

While investigating test failures related to the DealService's price history functionality, we identified a critical schema mismatch in the PriceHistory model:

1. **Duplicate Timestamp Fields**: The `PriceHistory` model defined both a `timestamp` field and a `created_at` field, but the database schema only had the `created_at` column. This caused errors when SQL operations attempted to reference the non-existent `timestamp` column.

2. **Schema Constraints Using Non-existent Column**: The model defined SQL constraints and indexes that referenced the `timestamp` column:
   - `UniqueConstraint('deal_id', 'timestamp', name='uq_price_history_deal_time')`
   - `Index('ix_price_histories_deal_time', 'deal_id', 'timestamp')`

3. **PriceHistoryBase Inconsistency**: The `PriceHistoryBase` model, which serves as a base for API schemas, was using `timestamp` while the actual database operations were referencing `created_at`.

## Fixes Implemented

The following changes were made to resolve these issues:

1. **Updated PriceHistoryBase Model**:
   ```python
   # Before
   class PriceHistoryBase(BaseModel):
       timestamp: datetime
       # other fields...
   
   # After
   class PriceHistoryBase(BaseModel):
       created_at: datetime
       # other fields...
   ```

2. **Removed Redundant Field from PriceHistory Model**:
   ```python
   # Removed field
   timestamp: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), default=datetime.utcnow)
   ```

3. **Updated Constraints and Indexes**:
   ```python
   # Before
   UniqueConstraint('deal_id', 'timestamp', name='uq_price_history_deal_time')
   Index('ix_price_histories_deal_time', 'deal_id', 'timestamp')
   
   # After
   UniqueConstraint('deal_id', 'created_at', name='uq_price_history_deal_time')
   Index('ix_price_histories_deal_time', 'deal_id', 'created_at')
   ```

4. **Updated String Representation Method**:
   ```python
   # Before
   def __repr__(self) -> str:
       return "<PriceHistory {} {} at {}>".format(self.price, self.currency, self.timestamp)
   
   # After
   def __repr__(self) -> str:
       return "<PriceHistory {} {} at {}>".format(self.price, self.currency, self.created_at)
   ```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Schema Consistency**: The ORM model now correctly aligns with the actual database schema.
2. **Simplified Implementation**: Removed redundant fields and consistently uses `created_at` for timestamp functionality.
3. **Resolved SQL Errors**: Eliminated errors that occurred when operations tried to reference the non-existent `timestamp` column.
4. **Improved Code Maintainability**: Reduced confusion by having a single field for recording when a price history entry was created.

## Similar Issues

This fix follows the same pattern as the previous fix for the `DealScore` model, which also had inconsistencies between `timestamp` and `created_at` fields. The system now consistently uses `created_at` for tracking when records were created.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Database Migration Validation**: Implement validation to ensure that ORM models match the actual database schema during deployment.
2. **Consistent Field Naming**: Establish conventions for timestamp fields and ensure they are followed across all models.
3. **Schema Review**: Periodically review database schemas and ORM models to identify and fix inconsistencies.
4. **Documentation**: Document clearly which timestamp fields should be used for which purposes across the system.
