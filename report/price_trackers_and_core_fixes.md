# Price Trackers and Core System Fixes
Date: February 27, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing `price_trackers` Table
- **Issue**: Tests were failing with `UndefinedTableError: relation "price_trackers" does not exist` during database operations.
- **Fix**: 
  - Added a proper `price_trackers` table in the migration file `20240219_000001_initial_schema.py`
  - Added the table to both the main CREATE TABLE section and the DROP TABLE section
  - Added a trigger for `update_price_trackers_updated_at` to update the `updated_at` column

### 2. ORM Relationship Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: The Deal model had a relationship to a `price_trackers` table that the ORM expected to exist but wasn't in the database schema.
- **Fix**:
  - Removed the non-existent relationship reference from `core/models/relationships.py`
  - Removed the related User-PriceTracker relationships
  - Updated `database.py` to remove the non-existent relationship references

### 3. Authentication Function Issues
- **Issue**: The `get_current_user` function was using `await result.unique().scalar_one_or_none()` which caused "object User can't be used in 'await' expression" errors.
- **Fix**: Modified the function to use `result.scalars().first()` instead, which is the correct way to get the first result from a query.

### 4. Cache Service Issues
- **Issue**: The `pipeline` and `ping` methods in the CacheService were not properly handling different Redis implementations.
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced the `pipeline` method to handle various Redis implementations, particularly for testing environments
  - Improved the `ping` method to add better error handling and graceful degradation

### 5. Task Metadata Management
- **Issue**: Task metadata wasn't being properly stored or updated in Redis, causing task listing and cleanup to fail.
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced the `create_task` method to ensure proper storage of task metadata
  - Improved logging for better debugging
  - Made sure task status is updated at each stage (pending → running → completed/failed)

## Database Schema Changes

### Added `price_trackers` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE price_trackers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    deal_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES deals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    initial_price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    threshold_price NUMERIC(10, 2),
    check_interval INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 300,
    last_check TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    notification_settings JSONB,
    meta_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE INDEX ix_price_trackers_deal_id ON price_trackers(deal_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_price_trackers_user_id ON price_trackers(user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_price_trackers_is_active ON price_trackers(is_active);
```

### Added `price_trackers` Update Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_price_trackers_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON price_trackers
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Database Consistency**: Ensured the database schema aligns with the application's expectations by adding the missing table.
2. **ORM Alignment**: Fixed inconsistencies between ORM models and the actual database schema by removing non-existent relationships.
3. **Improved Authentication Flow**: Fixed authentication functions to use the correct SQLAlchemy pattern.
4. **Enhanced Testing**: Improved mock implementations for Redis to better simulate real-world behavior in tests.
5. **Better Task Management**: Enhanced task metadata handling for more reliable task listing and cleanup.
6. **Improved Error Handling**: Added more robust error handling across services.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Schema Validation**: Implement a validation mechanism at startup to verify that ORM models match the actual database schema.
2. **Testing Improvement**: Create specific tests for relationship cascades to catch similar issues earlier.
3. **Systematic Testing**: Run tests after schema changes to catch relationship inconsistencies.
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation of the database schema and ORM models updated to prevent future mismatches.
5. **Type Validation**: Add stronger type validation throughout the codebase.
6. **Monitoring**: Add instrumentation to track and alert on database errors in production.
