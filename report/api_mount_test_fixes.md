# API Mount Test Fixes

## Issue Summary

The API mount test was failing due to several issues:

1. **DATABASE_URL Reference Error**: The test was failing with a `NameError` stating that 'DATABASE_URL' was not defined in the settings module.

2. **AsyncClient Usage Issues**: The test was trying to await a synchronous response, resulting in a `TypeError: object Response can't be used in 'await' expression`.

3. **APITestClient Initialization**: The `APITestClient` class required a client parameter but didn't provide a default.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed DATABASE_URL Reference in Settings

Updated `backend/core/config/settings.py` to safely check if DATABASE_URL is defined before using it:

```python
# Before
if "sqlite" not in DATABASE_URL.lower() and os.environ.get("TEST_DATABASE_URL") is None:
    DATABASE_URL = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:"

# After
if 'DATABASE_URL' in locals() and DATABASE_URL and "sqlite" not in DATABASE_URL.lower() and os.environ.get("TEST_DATABASE_URL") is None:
    DATABASE_URL = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:"
```

Similar changes were made for the REDIS_URL configuration.

### 2. Fixed APITestClient Initialization

Updated `backend/backend_tests/utils/test_client.py` to provide a default client if none is provided:

```python
# Before
def __init__(self, client: Union[TestClient, httpx.AsyncClient], base_url: str = "/api/v1"):
    self.client = client
    self.base_url = base_url
    self.headers = {}

# After
def __init__(self, client: Optional[Union[TestClient, httpx.AsyncClient]] = None, base_url: str = "/api/v1"):
    if client is None:
        # Create a default client if none provided
        self.client = TestClient(app)
    else:
        self.client = client
    self.base_url = base_url
    self.headers = {}
```

### 3. Fixed Async Client Usage in API Mount Test

Updated `backend/backend_tests/integration/test_api/api_mount_test.py` to use synchronous methods instead of trying to await them:

```python
# Before
response = await client.get(endpoint)

# After
response = client.get(endpoint)
```

This change was applied to both the regular endpoint testing and the UUID endpoint testing sections.

## Results

After implementing these changes, the API mount test now passes successfully. The test verifies that all API endpoints are properly mounted and accessible, with appropriate status codes returned for each endpoint.

The test now correctly handles:
- Regular endpoints like `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/auth/login`
- Endpoints with trailing slashes
- Special cases for the deals endpoint (which can return 401, 404, or 405)
- UUID-based endpoints that require parameters

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize Test Client Usage**: Ensure consistent usage of either synchronous or asynchronous clients throughout the test suite.

2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more descriptive error messages to help diagnose test failures.

3. **Document Expected Status Codes**: Maintain a central registry of expected status codes for each endpoint to make tests more maintainable.

4. **Fix Deals Router Issues**: Address the underlying issues with the deals router that cause it to return 404 in some contexts but 401 in others.
