# Linter Error Fixes - April 17, 2024

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Missing Parameter in Agent Service Methods
- Linter errors in `backend/core/services/agent.py` indicated:
  ```
  No value for argument 'obj_in' in method call
  ```
- The `create()` method was being called without the required named parameter in agent creation methods.
- This affected multiple methods: `create_goal_analyst()`, `create_deal_finder()`, `create_price_analyst()`, and `create_notifier()`.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Method Access in Alembic Migration
- Linter errors in `backend/migrations/versions/20240219_000001_initial_schema.py` indicated:
  ```
  Module 'alembic.op' has no 'get_context' member
  ```
- The migration file was using `op.get_context().bind` to access the database connection, which is incorrect.
- This occurred in both the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Added Missing Parameter to Agent Service Methods
- Updated all agent creation methods to use the required named parameter syntax:
  ```python
  return await self.create(obj_in=agent_data)
  ```
- This ensures the method calls match the base class method signature and properly pass the agent creation data.

### Fix 2: Fixed Alembic Connection Access
- Changed `op.get_context().bind` to `op.get_bind()` in both the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions.
- `op.get_bind()` is the correct method to get the SQLAlchemy connection from Alembic operations.

## Testing Results
These fixes address static code analysis issues that would prevent proper code execution:
- The agent creation methods now correctly pass parameters to the base class method.
- The migration file now uses the correct Alembic API to access the database connection.

## Future Recommendations
1. Run linter checks regularly during development to catch parameter mismatches early.
2. When extending base classes, ensure proper parameter passing with named arguments to maintain compatibility.
3. Keep Alembic API reference documentation available when writing migrations.
4. Consider adding type hints to method parameters to make requirements more explicit.
