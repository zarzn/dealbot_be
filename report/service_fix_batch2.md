# Service Fixes Batch 2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing BALANCE_CACHE_TTL in Settings Class

**Problem**: The `Settings` class was missing the `BALANCE_CACHE_TTL` setting, causing errors when trying to cache token balances.

**Solution**: Added the missing setting to the `Settings` class in `backend/core/config/settings.py`:

```python
BALANCE_CACHE_TTL: int = Field(default=1800, description="Token balance cache TTL in seconds")
```

### 2. Missing Repository Methods in TokenRepository

**Problem**: The `TokenRepository` class was missing several required methods that were being called from the `SolanaTokenService`, specifically:
- `transfer_tokens`
- `deduct_tokens`
- `get_transaction_history`

**Solution**: Implemented these methods in the `TokenRepository` class with proper error handling, balance checks, and transaction management.

### 3. MarketService Method Issues

**Problem**: The `MarketService` class had several issues:
- The `get_market` method was incorrectly initializing `DatabaseError`
- The `update_market` method was not accepting keyword arguments
- The class was missing several required methods that were being tested

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `DatabaseError` initialization in `get_market` by providing the correct parameters
- Updated the `update_market` method to accept keyword arguments instead of a `MarketUpdate` object
- Implemented the missing methods:
  - `list_markets`
  - `validate_market_config`
  - `test_market_connection`

## Implementation Details

### TokenRepository Methods

The implemented methods provide the following functionality:

1. `transfer_tokens` - Transfers tokens between users with proper transaction records and balance history
2. `deduct_tokens` - Deducts tokens from a user's balance with transaction records and balance history
3. `get_transaction_history` - Retrieves a user's transaction history with pagination

### MarketService Methods

The implemented methods provide the following functionality:

1. `list_markets` - Lists markets with optional filters
2. `update_market` - Updates a market's details using keyword arguments
3. `validate_market_config` - Validates market configuration data
4. `test_market_connection` - Tests the connection to a market API

## Lessons Learned

1. Always check for expected parameters when initializing exception classes
2. Ensure repository methods are implemented to support service operations
3. Service methods should accept flexible parameters (keyword arguments) to make testing easier
4. Configuration settings should be properly defined to support caching and other operations

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining issues with MarketRepository implementation
2. Implement missing methods in DatabaseRepository class
3. Update TokenService implementation to properly handle transaction validation
4. Ensure all service constructors properly accept both db_session and redis_service parameters
