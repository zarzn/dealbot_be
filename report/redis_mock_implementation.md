# Redis Mock Implementation for Goal Service Tests

## Issue Description

Tests for the Goal Service were failing with Redis connection errors, specifically:

```
Error 11001 connecting to redis:6379. getaddrinfo failed.
```

This error was occurring because the tests were trying to connect to an actual Redis server at the hostname "redis" on port 6379, but this server was not available in the test environment.

## Problem Analysis

1. The test environment was trying to connect to a real Redis server rather than using a mock
2. The `conftest.py` file was configured to connect to Redis using `redis://:{os.environ['REDIS_PASSWORD']}@localhost:6379/1`
3. The `goal_service` fixture was using the real Redis service by calling `get_redis_service()`
4. Multiple test failures occurred in functions that interact with Redis:
   - `_cache_goal`
   - `_get_cached_goal`
   - `_invalidate_goal_cache`
   - Other Redis-dependent operations

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Created a Redis Mock

Created a comprehensive mock implementation in `backend/backend_tests/mocks/redis_mock.py` that:

- Simulates Redis storage with in-memory Python dictionaries
- Implements key methods like `get`, `set`, `delete`, `exists`, etc.
- Handles key expiration
- Provides mock implementations for lists and other data structures
- Simulates pipeline operations
- Handles token blacklisting operations

### 2. Updated Test Configuration

1. Modified `conftest.py` to use our Redis mock instead of trying to connect to a real Redis server:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
   async def redis_client() -> AsyncGenerator[Redis, None]:
       """Create a test Redis connection using our mock."""
       from backend_tests.mocks.redis_mock import redis_mock
       
       # Reset the mock Redis state
       await redis_mock.flushdb()
       
       yield redis_mock
       
       # Clean up after test
       await redis_mock.flushdb()
   ```

2. Created a Redis service mock in `backend/backend_tests/mocks/redis_service_mock.py` that provides a mock implementation of the `get_redis_service()` function:
   ```python
   async def get_redis_service_mock() -> RedisService:
       """Get mocked Redis service instance."""
       global redis_service_instance
       
       if redis_service_instance is None:
           # Create a new instance of RedisService
           redis_service_instance = RedisService()
           # Initialize with our redis_mock
           await redis_service_instance.init(client=redis_mock)
           logger.info("Initialized Redis service with mock client")
       
       return redis_service_instance
   ```

3. Updated the `goal_service` fixture in `test_goal_service.py` to use our mocked Redis service:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   async def goal_service(db_session):
       # Use our mocked Redis service
       redis_service = await get_redis_service_mock()
       return GoalService(db_session, redis_service)
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Isolation**: Tests no longer depend on external Redis server availability
2. **Speed**: In-memory mocks are faster than real Redis operations
3. **Predictability**: Tests have deterministic behavior without Redis-related flakiness
4. **Simplicity**: No need to configure and maintain a Redis server for testing
5. **Debuggability**: Easier to identify issues in the code vs. Redis connection problems

## Testing Verification

After implementing the Redis mock, the tests now run successfully without Redis connection errors. Any remaining failures are due to actual code issues rather than infrastructure problems.

## Lessons Learned

1. Always use mocks for external dependencies in unit tests
2. Create comprehensive mock implementations that cover all needed functionality
3. Ensure test configuration properly injects mocks instead of real services
4. Document the mocking strategy for other developers
5. Separate test failures due to code issues from infrastructure problems

The Redis mock implementation provides a robust solution for testing Redis-dependent code without requiring an actual Redis server, ensuring tests are reliable, fast, and focused on testing application logic rather than infrastructure.
