# Deal Relationships Test Fix

## Issue
The test `test_deal_relationships` in `backend/backend_tests/core/test_models/test_deal.py` was failing with a `MissingGreenlet` exception. This error occurs in SQLAlchemy 2.0 when a synchronous operation attempts to access data that requires an asynchronous database fetch.

## Root Cause
The test was asserting relationships between the deal and other entities (user, goal, market) without properly loading these relationships in an asynchronous context first. Specifically, lines like `assert deal in user.deals` were trying to synchronously access the `user.deals` relationship, but this relationship hadn't been loaded yet within the asynchronous context.

## Fix
The solution implemented several key changes to the test function:

1. Properly marked the test function with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to ensure it runs in an asynchronous context.
2. Added explicit refreshes for the relationship objects before attempting to access their relationships:
   ```python
   await db_session.refresh(user, ["deals"])
   assert deal in user.deals
   
   await db_session.refresh(goal, ["deals"])
   assert deal in goal.deals
   
   await db_session.refresh(market, ["deals"])
   assert deal in market.deals
   ```
3. Used `db_session.flush()` instead of `db_session.commit()` when testing cascading deletes, which is more appropriate for test cases.
4. Added an explicit assertion to verify the deal was deleted when the goal was deleted, making the test more thorough.

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. All relationship data is properly loaded before assertions are made
2. The test correctly validates the relationships between Deal and related entities
3. The test runs successfully in SQLAlchemy 2.0's asynchronous context
4. The cascading delete behavior is properly tested

The fix provides a good example of how to properly test relationships in SQLAlchemy 2.0 with an asynchronous approach, which can be applied to other similar tests in the codebase.
