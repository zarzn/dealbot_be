# Async Deal Service Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing `await` in `get_deal` method**
   - **Problem**: The `get_deal` method in `DealService` was not awaiting the result of the repository's `get_by_id` call, causing a coroutine object to be returned instead of the actual Deal object.
   - **Solution**: Added the `await` keyword to properly wait for the asynchronous repository call to complete.
   - **Location**: `backend/core/services/deal.py`
   - **Code Changed**:
   ```python
   # Before
   deal = self._repository.get_by_id(deal_id)
   
   # After
   deal = await self._repository.get_by_id(deal_id)
   ```

2. **Unique Constraint Violations in Price History Tests**
   - **Problem**: The `test_deal_price_tracking` test was failing with unique constraint violations when adding multiple price points to the same deal with very close timestamps.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created a unique deal for each test run with a timestamp in the URL
     - Added a small delay (`asyncio.sleep(0.1)`) between price point additions to ensure different timestamps
     - Updated assertions to match the actual structure of the price history response
   - **Location**: `backend/backend_tests/services/test_deal_service.py`
   - **Code Changed**:
   ```python
   # Before
   deal = await DealFactory.create_async(db_session=db_session)
   # ...
   history = await deal_service.get_price_history(deal.id)
   assert len(history) == 2
   assert history[1].price == Decimal("89.99")
   
   # After
   # Create a unique deal with timestamped URL
   deal_data = {
       "url": f"https://test.com/deal/price_tracking_{datetime.now().timestamp()}",
       # other fields...
   }
   # ...
   await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Wait to ensure different timestamps
   # ...
   updated_history = await deal_service.get_price_history(deal.id)
   assert 'prices' in updated_history
   assert len(updated_history['prices']) == 2
   ```

## Impact

1. The fixes resolved coroutine handling issues in the DealService, ensuring that asynchronous calls are properly awaited.
2. The test_deal_price_tracking test now creates unique deals for each test run and includes sufficient delay between operations to avoid unique constraint violations.
3. Assertions were updated to match the actual structure of the response objects from the service.

## Prevention

1. Always ensure asynchronous functions properly await any coroutines they call.
2. In tests involving timestamp-sensitive operations, add sufficient delay between operations or ensure uniqueness through other means.
3. For factory-created objects that have unique constraints, ensure test case independence by adding unique identifiers (such as timestamps).
4. When working with APIs that return JSON-like objects, ensure assertions match the actual structure of the responses.
