# Integration Test Fix Report

## Issue Description

The integration tests for the API endpoints were failing with 404 Not Found errors, particularly the `test_create_goal_api` test. After investigation, we identified several issues:

1. **Token Transaction Factory Issue**: The token transaction factory was not explicitly setting the transaction type, leading to a validation error.

2. **TestClient Usage**: The test was trying to use `await` with the `TestClient`, which is synchronous, causing TypeError.

3. **API Route Configuration**: The API endpoints were correctly defined in the application but were not being accessed correctly in the tests.

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Transaction Type**: In `TokenTransactionFactory.create_async()`, the transaction type validation was failing because it wasn't being set in the test.

2. **Async/Sync Mismatch**: The test fixture provides a synchronous `TestClient`, but the test was trying to use it with `await`.

3. **API Prefix Configuration**: The API uses `/api/v1` prefix, but there may be inconsistencies in how this is applied between the application and test environments.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed Token Transaction**: Added explicit transaction type in the test creation:
   ```python
   await TokenTransactionFactory.create_async(
       db_session=db_session,
       user_id=auth_headers["user_id"],
       amount=Decimal("100.0"),
       type="reward"  # Added this line to fix the issue
   )
   ```

2. **Removed Async Usage with TestClient**: Updated the test to use the client synchronously:
   ```python
   # Changed
   response = await client.post(...)
   
   # To
   response = client.post(...)
   ```

3. **API Router Configuration**: Verified the API prefixes in the main application and updated the test to use the correct URL paths.

4. **Redirect Slashes**: Added `redirect_slashes=False` to the FastAPI application configuration to prevent issues with trailing slashes in URLs.

## Testing Results

After implementing these fixes:

1. The token transaction validation error was resolved.
2. The async/sync mismatch error was fixed.
3. The API routes are now correctly accessed in the tests.

## Further Recommendations

1. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to clearly explain the TestClient usage patterns.
2. **Test Structure**: Consider separating sync and async test fixtures to prevent confusion.
3. **Configuration Consistency**: Ensure consistent API prefix configuration across all environments.
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages in the tests to better identify similar issues in the future.
