# Deal Service and Test Fixes

## Issues Identified

After running the tests, we found several critical issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Foreign Key Violation in Deal Tests**:
   - Error: `IntegrityError: INSERT или UPDATE в таблице "deals" нарушает ограничение внешнего ключа "deals_user_id_fkey"`
   - Problem: The user ID referenced in the test does not exist in the users table.
   - File: `backend_tests/services/test_deal_service.py`

2. **Deal Score Creation Issues**:
   - Error: `NotNullViolationError: значение NULL в столбце "deal_id" отношения "deal_scores" нарушает ограничение NOT NULL`
   - Problem: Attempting to create a deal score without a valid deal_id.

3. **PromptTemplate Error in LLM Chain**:
   - Error: `Input to PromptTemplate is missing variables {'description', 'price', 'product_name', 'source'}`
   - Problem: Incorrect input format to the LLM chain.

4. **Update Deal Test Failing**:
   - Error: `AssertionError: assert 'Deal for item' == 'Updated Deal'`
   - Problem: The `update_deal` method isn't updating the title correctly.

5. **Issue with get_deal Test**:
   - Error: `RetryError[<Future at 0x255a4715f50 state=finished raised DealNotFound...`
   - Problem: The get_deal test is failing because the deal is not found.

## Fix Plan

### 1. Fix Foreign Key Violation in Deal Tests

The tests need to ensure that they're creating valid users before attempting to create deals that reference them. We need to:

1. Verify the test fixture is properly creating users before tests run
2. Ensure user IDs used in tests are valid and exist in the database
3. Consider using factory patterns for consistent test data creation

### 2. Fix Deal Score Creation

1. Update the `_calculate_deal_score` method to only attempt to store scores for deals that have already been created
2. Add proper null checks before attempting to store scores
3. Ensure deal_id is always provided when creating a score

### 3. Fix LLM Chain Input Format

1. Update the LLM chain invocation to match the expected input format
2. Ensure all required variables are provided to the PromptTemplate
3. Consider updating the PromptTemplate to handle missing variables gracefully

### 4. Fix Update Deal Method

1. Update the `update_deal` method in the DealService to ensure it correctly passes all fields to the repository
2. Ensure the repository's `update` method properly applies all updates
3. Add debugging to verify the update data is being correctly processed

### 5. Fix get_deal Test

1. Ensure deals are properly created before attempting to get them
2. Check the retry mechanism in the get_deal method
3. Verify the correct ID is being used when retrieving deals

## Implementation Steps

1. First, fix the test fixtures to ensure users are created properly
2. Update the deal creation process to validate user existence
3. Fix the update_deal method to correctly update all fields
4. Update the LLM chain invocation format
5. Fix the deal score creation process to handle null deal_ids

These changes should resolve the main issues with the tests. After implementation, we should run the tests again to verify the fixes have resolved the issues.
