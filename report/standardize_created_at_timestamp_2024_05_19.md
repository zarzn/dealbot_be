# Standardization of Timestamp Fields - May 19, 2024

## Issue Identified

The `price_histories` table was using both `timestamp` and `created_at` fields, causing inconsistency across the database schema. This led to confusion in code and potential bugs when working with time-related data.

The unique constraint `uq_price_history_deal_time` was using `(deal_id, timestamp)` while the model was attempting to use `(deal_id, created_at)` in some places, leading to integrity constraint violations.

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made:

1. Removed the `timestamp` field from the `PriceHistory` model:
   - Updated the model in `backend/core/models/deal.py` to remove the `timestamp` field
   - Ensured the unique constraint and index use `created_at` instead of `timestamp`

2. Updated the database schema in the initial migration:
   - Modified `backend/migrations/versions/20240219_000001_initial_schema.py` to remove the `timestamp` column
   - Updated the unique constraint to use `(deal_id, created_at)` 
   - Updated the index to use `(deal_id, created_at)`

3. Ensured all tests consistently use `created_at`:
   - Verified and updated the test code in `backend/backend_tests/features/test_agents/test_agent_features.py`
   - Added a comment to clarify that `created_at` is now used for the unique time value

## Benefits of Standardization

1. **Consistency**: All models now use `created_at` for the creation timestamp, making the codebase more intuitive and easier to maintain.

2. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed redundant fields that served similar purposes, simplifying the schema.

3. **Fewer Bugs**: Eliminates confusion between `timestamp` and `created_at`, preventing errors in code that interacts with price history.

4. **Better Maintainability**: Unified approach to timestamps makes future development and database management easier.

## Testing

The database schema changes must be applied by:
1. Running the `setup_db.py` script to recreate the database with the updated schema
2. Verifying that all tests pass with the standardized schema

This change ensures a more consistent and maintainable database structure for the AI Agentic Deals System.
