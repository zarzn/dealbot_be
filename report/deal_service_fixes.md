# Deal Service Fixes Report

## Issues Identified

1. **UUID Validation Errors**:
   - Several methods were incorrectly passing string values where UUIDs were expected
   - The `get_deal` method was trying to use 'non-existent-id' as a UUID, which fails validation
   - In `_calculate_deal_score`, the product name was being passed to `get_price_history` which expected a UUID

2. **Redis Caching Issues**:
   - The `_cache_deal` method was using the product name instead of deal.id when getting price history
   - Error handling was missing when Redis operations failed

3. **Update Deal Method**:
   - The method failed to properly update the title and other fields
   - The issue was in the repository's update method implementation

4. **List Deals Method**:
   - The method didn't accept the optional parameters that were being passed in tests
   - Parameters like `user_id`, `goal_id`, `market_id`, and `min_price/max_price` were needed

5. **PriceHistory Unique Constraint Violations**:
   - When adding price points, there are unique constraint violations on the "uq_price_history_deal_time" constraint
   - This suggests that we need to ensure timestamps are unique between test runs

## Implemented Fixes

1. **UUID Handling**:
   - Updated `test_get_deal` to use a valid UUID format ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")
   - Modified `_calculate_deal_score` to handle the get_price_history call correctly by checking for deal.id first
   - Added proper error handling for UUID-related operations

2. **Redis Caching Improvements**:
   - Updated `_cache_deal` to use deal.id for retrieving price history
   - Added appropriate error handling to prevent crashes when Redis operations fail
   - Added conditional checks for attribute existence before using attributes

3. **Fixed Update Method**:
   - Improved the Repository's update method to properly set all fields from the update data
   - Added check to ensure the deal exists before attempting to update
   - Used model_dump with exclude_unset=True to handle Pydantic v2 compatibility

4. **List Deals Method Enhancement**:
   - Added optional parameters to the method signature: user_id, goal_id, market_id, status, min_price, and max_price
   - Implemented client-side filtering for these parameters
   - Added proper documentation for the parameters

5. **Score Calculation Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error handling in score calculation to prevent crashes due to UUID errors
   - Made the historical scores logic more robust with default empty lists

## Remaining Issues

1. **Unique Constraint Violations**:
   - The test_deal_price_tracking test still fails due to unique constraint violations
   - May need to add random delays or unique timestamps in tests

2. **create_deal_score Method**:
   - Warning about unexpected keyword arguments (`score_type` and `score_metadata`)
   - Need to update the parameter list to match the implementation

3. **Redis Mock**:
   - Some Redis operations fail with "'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol"
   - Need to improve the mock implementation or add better error handling

## Next Steps

1. Fix the test_deal_price_tracking test to avoid unique constraint violations
2. Update the create_deal_score method parameters
3. Improve the Redis mock implementation
4. Fix remaining test failures
