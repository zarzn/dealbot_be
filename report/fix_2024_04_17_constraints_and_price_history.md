# Fix Report: Goal Constraints and Price History Issues

## Date: April 17, 2024

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Missing Price Trackers Table
- The `price_trackers` table was missing from the initial database schema.
- This was causing tests related to price tracking functionality to fail.
- The table references were properly defined in the models but not in the database schema.

### Issue 2: Goal Constraints Validation Error
- Test `test_deal_matching_agent_workflow` was failing with `GoalConstraintError: Missing required constraint fields: brands, max_price, min_price, keywords, conditions`.
- When creating a Goal with just a description, the GoalFactory was not adding the required constraint fields.

### Issue 3: Price History Foreign Key Violation
- Test `test_price_prediction_workflow` was failing with `ForeignKeyViolationError` when trying to add price points.
- The error indicated that a deal ID being referenced didn't exist in the deals table.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Added Price Trackers Table
- Added the `price_trackers` table to the initial migration script with all required columns and foreign key relationships.
- Ensured proper relationship between `deals` and `price_trackers` tables.

### Fix 2: Updated GoalFactory
- Modified the `create_async` method in GoalFactory to ensure all required constraint fields are added.
- Ensured the description field doesn't replace existing constraints but adds to them.
- Added default values for all required constraint fields when creating a Goal instance.

### Fix 3: Fixed Deal Testing Logic
- Identified cause of foreign key violation in price history testing.
- Ensured that when testing price points, the deal is properly created and committed to the database before adding price points.

## Testing Results
After applying these fixes:
- The database schema now includes all required tables with proper relationships.
- Goal creation tests now pass with proper constraint validation.
- Price history and price prediction tests now work correctly.

## Future Recommendations
1. When adding new models, ensure corresponding table definitions are added to migration scripts.
2. Always validate that factories create objects that pass all model validations.
3. Add more comprehensive tests for constraint validation and foreign key relationships.
