# Test Failure Fix Report - April 17, 2024

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: ForeignKeyViolationError in test_price_prediction_workflow
When adding price history points to a deal in test, we encountered a foreign key violation error:
```
ForeignKeyViolationError: INSERT или UPDATE в таблице "price_histories" нарушает ограничение внешнего ключа "price_histories_deal_id_fkey"
DETAIL: Ключ (deal_id)=(1c95f362-fd82-4023-908e-6b1cbbee9897) отсутствует в таблице "deals".
```

The issue was that the deal was created in the current session but not committed to the database before price points were added. The `add_price_history` method in the `DealRepository` checks if the deal exists in the database, but without committing the session, the deal was only visible within the transaction.

### Issue 2: ValueError in test_deal_matching_agent_workflow 
When creating a deal with a higher price (1500.00) than the default original price (149.99) in the DealFactory, a validation error was triggered:
```
ValueError: Original price must be greater than current price
```

This occurred because the `DealFactory.create_async` method has a validation check that requires the original price to be greater than the current price, but it wasn't properly handling cases where a custom price was provided without an original price.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Commit Session After Deal Creation
Modified `test_price_prediction_workflow` to commit the session immediately after creating the deal:
```python
deal = await DealFactory.create_async(db_session=db_session)
# Commit the session to ensure the deal is persisted in the database
await db_session.commit()
```

This ensures the deal is actually persisted in the database before adding price history entries, satisfying the foreign key constraint.

### Fix 2: Auto-Adjust Original Price Based on Current Price
Modified `DealFactory.create_async` to automatically set the original price higher when a custom price is provided:
```python
# Validate original price
if 'price' in kwargs and 'original_price' not in kwargs:
    # If price is specified but original_price is not, set original_price higher than price
    kwargs['original_price'] = price * Decimal('1.2')  # 20% higher than the current price
```

This ensures that when creating deals with custom prices, the original price is set to a value that satisfies the validation requirement.

### Fix 3: Applied the Same Session Commit Fix to test_deal_matching_agent_workflow
Added session commit after creating deals in the matching agent workflow test to ensure all deals are properly persisted.

## Testing Results

After applying these fixes:
- The test_price_prediction_workflow no longer experiences foreign key violations
- The test_deal_matching_agent_workflow no longer fails with original price validation errors
- All tests related to deal creation, price history, and matching are now passing

## Future Recommendations

1. **Session Management**: Always commit sessions when testing database interactions that involve foreign key relationships between entities created in the same test.

2. **Factory Validation**: Ensure that factories have smart defaults that adapt to provided parameters to avoid validation errors.

3. **Transaction Handling**: Consider enhancing the repository methods to better handle the case where entities exist in the current transaction but not yet in the wider database.

4. **Documentation**: Add notes to test files about the importance of committing sessions when working with related entities.

5. **Error Handling**: The error handling in the `add_price_history` method correctly identified the issue, but could be improved to provide more context about transaction state.
