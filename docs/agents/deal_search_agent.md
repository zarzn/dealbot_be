# Deal Search Agent

## Overview

The Deal Search Agent is a specialized AI agent within the AI Agentic Deals System responsible for efficiently discovering, analyzing, and retrieving relevant deals across multiple market sources. It acts as the primary search interface between user queries and available deal opportunities, employing advanced natural language processing and semantic matching to deliver personalized results.

## Architecture

### Position in the Agent System

The Deal Search Agent operates as a core component within the broader agent ecosystem:

### Component Structure

The Deal Search Agent consists of several internal components:

1. **Query Processor**: Interprets and enhances user search queries
2. **Source Router**: Determines which market sources to query
3. **Result Aggregator**: Combines and deduplicates results
4. **Relevance Ranker**: Scores deals based on user preferences
5. **Response Formatter**: Structures results in a consistent format

## Core Capabilities

### Natural Language Query Processing

The Deal Search Agent transforms unstructured natural language queries into structured search parameters by:

- Extracting product specifications and constraints
- Identifying price ranges and discount expectations
- Recognizing brand preferences and exclusions
- Understanding quality and review requirements
- Determining urgency and timing factors

### Multi-Source Integration

The agent integrates with various deal sources through a unified interface:

- E-commerce platforms (Amazon, eBay, Walmart)
- Deal aggregators (SlickDeals, DealNews)
- Manufacturer direct offers
- Loyalty program deals
- Limited-time flash sales

### Intelligent Filtering

Applies advanced filtering logic to identify the most valuable deals:

- Price history analysis to verify discount claims
- Quality-to-price ratio assessment
- Reputation-based merchant validation
- Availability and shipping time optimization
- Feature-to-need matching

### Personalization Factors

The agent customizes search results based on user-specific factors:

- Search history and past preferences
- Deal interaction patterns
- Purchase history when available
- Explicitly stated goals
- Geographic location constraints

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

The Deal Search Agent is implemented using:

- **Core Framework**: FastAPI for asynchronous request handling
- **Processing Engine**: Python with specialized NLP libraries
- **LLM Integration**: Primary model (DeepSeek R1) with fallback (GPT-4)
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequent searches and partial results
- **Metrics Storage**: PostgreSQL for performance tracking

### Performance Requirements

| Result Relevance Score | > 85% | > 70% |
| Source Coverage | > 90% of available sources | > 75% |
| Cache Hit Rate | > 60% | > 40% |
| Resource Usage | < 250MB memory per instance | < 400MB |

## Error Handling

The Deal Search Agent implements robust error handling to maintain service reliability:

### Error Types

1. **Query Processing Errors**
   - Invalid query format
   - Ambiguous search terms
   - Unsupported filter combinations

2. **Source Connection Errors**
   - Timeout from external sources
   - API rate limiting
   - Network connectivity issues

3. **Processing Errors**
   - Result aggregation failures
   - Ranking algorithm exceptions
   - Resource exhaustion

### Recovery Strategies

- **Degraded Service Mode**: Return partial results when some sources fail
- **Cached Fallback**: Serve slightly outdated results when fresh queries fail
- **Query Simplification**: Automatically simplify complex queries that exceed processing limits
- **Source Prioritization**: Focus on high-reliability sources during system stress

## Monitoring and Metrics

The Deal Search Agent collects the following metrics for operational monitoring:

- Query processing times (95th percentile)
- Source-specific latency and error rates
- Cache hit/miss ratio and invalidation frequency
- Relevance scores by query category
- User satisfaction via explicit and implicit feedback
- Token usage and cost per query

## Integration Points

### Inputs

- Receives search requests from the Conversation Agent
- Obtains user preferences from User Profile Service
- Retrieves deal goals from Goal Tracking Service

### Outputs

- Sends structured deal results to client interfaces
- Provides relevance feedback to the Personalization Agent
- Submits performance metrics to monitoring systems
- Logs search patterns for analytics

## Future Enhancements

1. **Query Intent Clustering**: Group similar queries to improve caching efficiency
2. **Multi-modal Search**: Support image-based and voice-based search inputs
3. **Real-time Price Tracking**: Alert users when previously searched items drop in price
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Automatically compare similar deals across different sources
5. **Seasonal Pattern Recognition**: Adjust search strategies based on historical deal patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Query parsing and transformation
- Source selection logic
- Result ranking algorithms
- Error handling and recovery paths

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end search flows
- Cross-source result aggregation
- Cache behavior under load
- Database interaction efficiency

### Performance Testing

- Concurrent query handling
- Response time under load
- Resource utilization scaling
- Recovery from simulated failures

## Development Guidelines

1. All new deal sources must implement the standardized `DealSourceInterface`
2. Cache invalidation must be selective rather than complete
3. Keep core search logic stateless to enable horizontal scaling
4. Implement circuit breakers for all external source connections
5. Follow the monitoring checklist for all new features
6. Document all query transformations for traceability
