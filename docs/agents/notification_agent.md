# Notification Agent

## Overview

The Notification Agent is a specialized AI-powered component within the AI Agentic Deals System responsible for intelligent notification management. It acts as the central coordination point for all user notifications, ensuring timely, relevant, and personalized communication while minimizing notification fatigue.

Unlike traditional notification systems that simply send alerts based on predetermined triggers, the Notification Agent employs artificial intelligence to determine when, how, and what information should be delivered to users based on their preferences, behavior patterns, and the urgency of information. This intelligent approach maximizes user engagement while respecting attention boundaries.

## Architecture

### Purpose & Core Capabilities

The Notification Agent serves multiple critical functions within the platform:

1. **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Orchestrates notifications across multiple channels (in-app, email, SMS, push) based on user preferences and message urgency.

2. **Intelligent Timing**: Uses AI to determine optimal notification timing based on user activity patterns and message priority.

3. **Personalized Content Generation**: Dynamically generates notification content tailored to individual users, incorporating their preferences and past interactions.

4. **User-Defined Preferences**: Respects granular user preferences for notification types, channels, frequency, and timing.

5. **Notification Aggregation**: Intelligently batches related notifications to prevent overwhelming users with multiple similar alerts.

6. **Event Analysis & Prioritization**: Analyzes incoming events to determine notification priority and urgency.

7. **Engagement Tracking**: Monitors notification effectiveness through open rates, click-through rates, and user actions.

### Component Structure

The Notification Agent consists of several specialized components:

1. **Notification Trigger**: Monitors events from various system components and determines if they warrant user notification based on defined rules and user preferences.

2. **Content Generator**: Creates personalized notification messages optimized for different delivery channels, leveraging templates and AI text generation.

3. **Delivery Manager**: Orchestrates the timing and channel selection for notification delivery, managing channel-specific formatting requirements.

4. **Notification Store**: Persists notification history and status, enabling retrieval of past notifications and tracking of read/unread status.

5. **Preference Manager**: Maintains and applies user-defined notification preferences across all notification types.

6. **Analytics Engine**: Tracks notification effectiveness metrics and feeds this data back to improve future notification strategies.

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

The Notification Agent leverages the following technologies:

- **FastAPI**: Core framework for API endpoints that control notification functionality
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions with notification-related tables
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue for handling notification events asynchronously
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for rendering notification content
- **Redis**: Caching layer for notification preferences and rate limiting
- **AWS SES**: Email delivery service
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Push notification service for mobile devices
- **Twilio**: SMS delivery service

### Notification Processing Flow

The Notification Agent follows a defined workflow for processing notifications:

1. **Event Detection**:
   - System events (price drops, expiring deals, etc.) are detected by relevant services
   - Events are published to the notification event queue

2. **Notification Evaluation**:
   - The Notification Trigger evaluates events against user preferences
   - Priority and urgency are determined based on event type and context

3. **Content Generation**:
   - The Content Generator creates personalized notification messages
   - Templates are populated with relevant data
   - Multiple variants are created for different channels

4. **Delivery Planning**:
   - The Delivery Manager determines optimal timing for notification
   - Channel selection is based on user preferences and message urgency

5. **Notification Storage**:
   - Notification details are persisted in the database
   - Delivery status is tracked for each channel

6. **Delivery Execution**:
   - Notifications are sent through appropriate channels
   - Delivery status is updated in real-time

7. **Engagement Tracking**:
   - User interactions with notifications are monitored
   - Analytics are collected for optimization

### Error Handling

The Notification Agent implements robust error handling:

| Error Type | Description | Resolution Strategy |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Delivery Failure** | Failed to deliver notification through a specific channel | Retry with exponential backoff; fall back to alternative channels |
| **Template Error** | Error in template rendering | Use fallback generic template; log detailed error |
| **Preference Conflict** | Conflicting user preferences | Apply most restrictive preference; log conflict |
| **Rate Limit Exceeded** | Too many notifications in short period | Queue for later delivery; apply intelligent batching |
| **Channel Unavailable** | External service unavailable | Retry with fallback services; queue for later delivery |
| **Invalid User** | User does not exist or is inactive | Log error; suppress notification |

### Monitoring & Metrics

The Notification Agent tracks key performance indicators:

#### Delivery Metrics
- Notification volume by type and channel
- Delivery success rate
- Delivery latency
- Channel reliability

#### User Engagement
- Open rates (by notification type and channel)
- Click-through rates
- Action completion rates
- Notification dismissal rates
- User feedback scores

#### System Health
- Queue backlog size
- Processing time per notification
- Error rates by error type and channel
- Template rendering performance

### Integration Points

The Notification Agent integrates with several internal and external systems:

#### Internal Integrations
- **Deal Service**: Receives price drop and deal expiration events
- **Goal Service**: Receives goal progress updates
- **User Service**: Accesses user profiles and preferences
- **Token Service**: Receives token balance updates
- **Analytics Service**: Provides notification effectiveness metrics

#### External Integrations
- **AWS SES**: For email delivery
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: For mobile push notifications
- **Twilio**: For SMS delivery
- **WebSocket Service**: For real-time in-app notifications

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the Notification Agent include:

1. **Advanced Personalization**: Using machine learning to personalize notification content based on user interaction history.

2. **Smart Batching**: Intelligent grouping of notifications based on content similarity and user behavior patterns.

3. **Conversational Notifications**: Interactive notifications that allow users to take actions directly within the notification.

4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Systematically testing different notification strategies to optimize engagement.

5. **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Ensuring notifications are synchronized across all user devices.

6. **Enhanced Channel Support**: Adding support for additional channels like web push, WhatsApp, and Slack.

1. Always include fallback values for all template variables
2. Keep templates channel-appropriate (length, formatting)
3. Follow the established template structure for consistency
4. Include i18n markers for future localization
5. Document all template variables with examples

### Notification Creation

1. Always provide appropriate metadata for context
2. Set realistic priority levels based on urgency
3. Use existing notification types when possible
4. Provide clear, actionable content
5. Include deep links where applicable

### Error Handling

1. Implement circuit breakers for external services
2. Log detailed error information for debugging
3. Use appropriate fallback mechanisms
4. Maintain delivery SLAs even during partial failures
5. Implement graceful degradation for all components

### Performance Optimization

1. Use caching for frequently accessed preferences
2. Implement batching for high-volume notifications
3. Use asynchronous processing where appropriate
4. Optimize database queries with proper indexing
5. Implement pagination for notification retrieval
