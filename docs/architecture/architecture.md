## System Overview

The AI Agentic Deals System is a microservices-inspired application designed for scraping, analyzing, and presenting deal opportunities. The system is built with the following key principles:

- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing loads without degradation
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns
- **Resilience**: Fault tolerance and graceful handling of failures
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Security**: Protection of sensitive data and operations

## Architecture Principles

The system architecture follows these fundamental principles:

1. **Service-Oriented Design**: Components are organized as independent services with well-defined interfaces
2. **API-First Approach**: All functionalities are exposed through consistent APIs
3. **Stateless Services**: Core application logic maintains minimal state
4. **Data Isolation**: Clear separation between data storage and processing
5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks handled asynchronously
6. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for performance optimization
7. **Graceful Degradation**: System remains operational with reduced functionality during partial failures

## High-Level Architecture

The system is divided into three main layers:

### 1. Client Layer
- Web frontend (Next.js)
- Mobile applications (future)
- API consumers

### 2. API Gateway Layer
- REST API endpoints
- WebSocket connections (for real-time updates)
- Authentication and rate limiting

### 3. Service Layer
- Core services
- Supporting services
- External service integrations

### 4. Data Layer
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- Object storage (for files and attachments)

## Data Flow Architecture

### Deal Scraping Flow

1. **Search Request Initiation**
   - User initiates search for deals
   - System validates search parameters

2. **Database Search**
   - System first checks for matches in the database
   - Returns cached results if available and fresh

3. **Real-time Scraping**
   - If no matches or cache expired, system initiates scraping
   - Multiple sources scraped in parallel
   - Results normalized and validated

4. **Result Processing**
   - Raw scraping results processed and enriched
   - Duplicate detection and removal
   - Data normalization

5. **Storage and Caching**
   - Processed results stored in database
   - Search results cached for future requests
   - Cache expiration set based on data freshness needs

6. **Response Delivery**
   - Results formatted and returned to user
   - Pagination and sorting applied
   - Analytics data recorded

### AI Analysis Flow

1. **Deal Selection**
   - User selects deals for analysis
   - System validates deals for analysis eligibility

2. **Context Gathering**
   - System gathers relevant context for analysis
   - Historical data retrieved
   - Market data incorporated

3. **AI Processing**
   - Context and deals sent to AI service
   - Primary model (DeepSeek) processes the request
   - Fallback to secondary model (OpenAI) if needed

4. **Result Generation**
   - AI generates analysis results
   - System validates and formats AI output
   - Results are stored for future reference

5. **Presentation**
   - Analysis results formatted for display
   - Visual elements (charts, graphs) generated
   - Interactive elements prepared

## AI Components Architecture

### LLM Configuration

The system uses multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with the following configuration:

1. **Primary Model**
   - DeepSeek R1
   - Used for main production workloads
   - Configured for optimal performance/cost balance

2. **Fallback Model**
   - GPT-4
   - Used when primary model fails or is unavailable
   - Configured with compatible parameters

3. **Test Environment**
   - Mock LLM for testing
   - No API key required
   - Used for unit tests and CI/CD

### AI Processing Pipeline

1. **Request Preprocessing**
   - Context preparation
   - Prompt engineering
   - Parameter configuration

2. **Model Selection**
   - Dynamic selection based on:
     - Task requirements
     - Model availability
     - Cost considerations
     - Performance metrics

3. **Request Execution**
   - API call to selected model
   - Timeout and retry handling
   - Error management

4. **Response Processing**
   - Response validation
   - Content filtering
   - Formatting and structuring

5. **Feedback Loop**
   - Model performance tracking
   - Response quality evaluation
   - Continuous improvement mechanisms

## Database Schema

### Core Entities

#### Users
- User identity and authentication data
- Profile information
- Preferences and settings

#### Deals
- Deal basic information
- Source metadata
- Categorization data
- Analysis results

#### Markets
- Market definitions
