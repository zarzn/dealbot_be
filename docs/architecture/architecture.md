## System Overview

The AI Agentic Deals System is a microservices-inspired application designed for scraping, analyzing, and presenting deal opportunities. The system is built with the following key principles:

- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing loads without degradation
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns
- **Resilience**: Fault tolerance and graceful handling of failures
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Security**: Protection of sensitive data and operations

## Architecture Principles

The system architecture follows these fundamental principles:

1. **Service-Oriented Design**: Components are organized as independent services with well-defined interfaces
2. **API-First Approach**: All functionalities are exposed through consistent APIs
3. **Stateless Services**: Core application logic maintains minimal state
4. **Data Isolation**: Clear separation between data storage and processing
5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks handled asynchronously
6. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for performance optimization
7. **Graceful Degradation**: System remains operational with reduced functionality during partial failures

## High-Level Architecture

The system is divided into three main layers:

### 1. Client Layer
- Web frontend (Next.js)

## Data Flow Architecture

### Deal Scraping Flow

1. **Search Request Initiation**
   - User initiates search for deals
   - System validates search parameters

2. **Database Search**
   - System first checks for matches in the database
   - Returns cached results if available and fresh

3. **Real-time Scraping**
   - If no matches or cache expired, system initiates scraping
   - Multiple sources scraped in parallel
   - Results normalized and validated

4. **Result Processing**
   - Raw scraping results processed and enriched
   - Duplicate detection and removal
   - Data normalization

5. **Storage and Caching**
   - Processed results stored in database
   - Search results cached for future requests
   - Cache expiration set based on data freshness needs

6. **Response Delivery**
   - Results formatted and returned to user
   - Pagination and sorting applied
   - Analytics data recorded

### AI Analysis Flow

1. **Deal Selection**
   - User selects deals for analysis
   - System validates deals for analysis eligibility

2. **Context Gathering**
   - System gathers relevant context for analysis
   - Historical data retrieved
   - Market data incorporated

3. **AI Processing**
   - Context and deals sent to AI service
   - Primary model (DeepSeek) processes the request
   - Fallback to secondary model (OpenAI) if needed

4. **Result Generation**
   - AI generates analysis results
   - System validates and formats AI output
   - Results are stored for future reference

5. **Presentation**
   - Analysis results formatted for display
   - Visual elements (charts, graphs) generated
   - Interactive elements prepared

## AI Components Architecture

### LLM Configuration

The AI Agentic Deals System uses multiple large language models (LLMs) with specific configurations:

1. **Production Environment**
   - Primary Model: DeepSeek R1
   - API Key: DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
   - Use Case: Main production model for deal analysis, recommendations, and natural language processing
   - Configuration: Temperature of 0.2-0.7 depending on the task, with appropriate token limits

2. **Fallback Configuration**
   - Model: GPT-4
   - API Key: OPENAI_API_KEY
   - Use Case: Backup when primary model fails or for specialized tasks
   - Activation: Automatic failover when primary model returns errors or times out

3. **Test Environment**
   - Model: Mock LLM
   - No API Key required
   - Use Case: Unit tests and CI/CD pipeline testing
   - Configuration: Deterministic responses for reliable testing

### AI Processing Pipeline

The AI processing pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Input Preparation**
   - User input validation and sanitization
   - Context gathering from relevant data sources
   - System prompt construction with appropriate instructions

2. **Model Selection**
   - Routing to appropriate model based on task requirements
   - Load balancing across API keys and rate limits
   - Fallback mechanism activation when needed

3. **Request Processing**
   - Asynchronous API calls to LLM providers
   - Timeout and retry mechanisms
   - Response validation and error handling

4. **Response Processing**
   - Parsing and validation of LLM responses
   - Extraction of structured data from LLM outputs
   - Application of business rules and constraints

5. **Result Integration**

### Agent Architecture

The system employs a multi-agent architecture for complex tasks:
