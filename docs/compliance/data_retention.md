2. **Storage Limitation**: Data is retained only for the periods specified in this policy
3. **Access Limitation**: Access to stored data is restricted based on need-to-know principles
4. **Processing Limitation**: Data processing is limited to specified business purposes

## Retention Implementation

### Technical Controls

The following technical measures implement this retention policy:

1. **Automated Purging**: Scheduled jobs that automatically purge or anonymize data based on retention schedules
2. **Storage Tiering**: Migration of aging data to appropriate storage tiers based on access patterns
3. **Data Tagging**: Metadata tagging of stored data with retention requirements
4. **Anonymization**: Automated anonymization of personal data when retention periods expire but aggregate data is still valuable
5. **Backup Rotation**: Backup retention schedules aligned with data retention policy

### Database Implementation

Retention periods are implemented through:

1. **Time-to-Live (TTL) Settings**: Database-level TTL settings where supported
2. **Scheduled Database Jobs**: Regular execution of data purging or anonymization scripts
3. **Partitioning Strategy**: Time-based partitioning to facilitate efficient data removal
4. **Soft Deletion**: Marking records as deleted before physical removal
5. **Cascading Deletion**: Properly managed referential integrity with cascading deletion

## Exceptions and Holds

### Legal Hold Process

Data subject to this policy may be exempted from scheduled deletion in the following circumstances:

1. **Litigation Hold**: When data is relevant to ongoing or anticipated legal proceedings
2. **Regulatory Investigation**: When data is subject to regulatory inquiry or investigation
3. **Security Incident**: When data is relevant to an ongoing security incident investigation
4. **User Request**: When a user has specifically requested data preservation

### Exception Approval Process

1. **Request Submission**: Legal or compliance team submits hold request
2. **Review and Approval**: Data Protection Officer reviews and approves/denies
3. **Implementation**: Technical team implements hold on specific data
4. **Documentation**: Hold details documented in legal hold register
5. **Periodic Review**: Holds reviewed quarterly for continued necessity

## Data Deletion and Anonymization

### Deletion Methods

The following methods are used for data deletion:

1. **Soft Deletion**: Marking records as deleted and excluding from normal access
2. **Hard Deletion**: Physical removal of data from production databases
3. **Cascading Deletion**: Removal of dependent records to maintain data integrity
4. **Backup Deletion**: Ensuring deleted data is eventually removed from backups

### Anonymization Techniques

When anonymization is appropriate, these techniques may be used:

1. **Data Masking**: Replacing sensitive data with placeholder values
2. **Generalization**: Reducing precision of data (e.g., exact age to age range)
3. **Pseudonymization**: Replacing identifiers with artificial identifiers
4. **Aggregation**: Converting individual data into statistical summaries
5. **Noise Addition**: Adding statistical noise to numerical data
