# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the AI Agentic Deals System. It defines the testing principles, methodologies, tools, and processes that ensure the system's quality, reliability, and performance across all components and integrations.

## Testing Principles

The AI Agentic Deals System follows these core testing principles:

1. **Shift-Left Testing**: Testing begins early in the development lifecycle to catch issues when they are least expensive to fix.
2. **Automation-First**: Automated tests are preferred over manual testing whenever possible.
3. **Risk-Based Approach**: Testing effort is prioritized based on risk assessment and business impact.
4. **Continuous Testing**: Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for immediate feedback.
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Testing addresses functional, non-functional, and specialized AI requirements.
6. **Quality Ownership**: All team members share responsibility for quality.
7. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Test results inform development priorities and release decisions.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation, focusing on code correctness and boundary conditions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fine-grained, focused on single functions or classes
- Fast execution (milliseconds per test)
- Independent of external dependencies (using mocks/stubs)
- High coverage (target: 80%+ for core modules)

**Example Unit Test Areas:**
- Core utility functions
- Data model validations
- Business logic components
- AI processing functions
- Token calculation algorithms

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example unit test for token calculation
def test_calculate_token_cost():
    # Arrange
    input_text = "Sample text with 10 tokens"
    expected_cost = 5  # Assuming 0.5 tokens per input token
    
    # Act
    actual_cost = calculate_token_cost(input_text)
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_cost == expected_cost
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify interactions between components, ensuring they work together correctly.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Tests component combinations
- Verifies interface contracts
- May involve real external dependencies or realistic mocks
- Typically slower than unit tests

**Example Integration Test Areas:**
- API endpoint flows
- Database operations
- Service interactions
- External API integrations
- Authentication flows

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example integration test for deal search API
async def test_deal_search_api():
    # Arrange
    search_params = {"query": "laptop", "max_price": 1000}
    
    # Act
    response = await client.post("/api/v1/deals/search", json=search_params)
    
    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert len(response.json()["deals"]) > 0
    assert all(deal["current_price"] <= 1000 for deal in response.json()["deals"])
```

### End-to-End Testing

E2E tests verify complete user workflows across the entire system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Tests complete user journeys
- Involves all system components
- Runs against an environment similar to production
- Slower execution, focused on critical paths

**Example E2E Test Areas:**
- User registration and onboarding
- Deal search and filtering
- Token purchase and spending
- Goal creation and tracking
- Deal sharing workflow

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example E2E test for user onboarding and first deal search
async def test_user_onboarding_and_search():
    # Register new user
    register_response = await client.post("/api/v1/auth/register", json=user_data)
    assert register_response.status_code == 201
    
    # Login
    login_response = await client.post("/api/v1/auth/login", json=login_data)
    assert login_response.status_code == 200
    token = login_response.json()["token"]
    
    # Set user preferences
    preferences_response = await client.patch(
        "/api/v1/users/me/preferences",
        json=preferences_data,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    )
    assert preferences_response.status_code == 200
    
    # Search for deals
    search_response = await client.post(
        "/api/v1/deals/search",
        json=search_data,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    )
    assert search_response.status_code == 200
    assert len(search_response.json()["deals"]) > 0
```

### Performance Testing

Performance tests evaluate system behavior under various load conditions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Measures response times, throughput, and resource utilization
- Identifies bottlenecks and scaling limits
- Tests system stability under sustained load
- Verifies performance requirements

**Example Performance Test Areas:**
- API response times under load
- Database query performance
- Concurrent user capacity
- Search operation latency
- Token system transaction throughput

**Performance Testing Types:**
1. **Load Testing**: Verify system behavior under expected load
2. **Stress Testing**: Find breaking points under extreme conditions
3. **Endurance Testing**: Verify stability over extended periods
4. **Spike Testing**: Test response to sudden traffic increases

## Specialized Testing Areas

### AI Component Testing

Testing AI functionality requires specialized approaches:

    expected_min_quality_score = 7.0
    
    # Act
    analysis_results = await analyze_deals(test_deals)
    
    # Assert
    for result in analysis_results:
        assert "quality_score" in result
        assert result["quality_score"] >= expected_min_quality_score
        assert "value_rating" in result
        assert result["summary"] and len(result["summary"]) > 50
```

### Token System Testing

The token economy requires specific testing approaches:

   - Concurrent transaction handling
   - Transaction rollback verification

3. **Service Integration Tests**:
   - Token charging for premium features
   - Reward distribution accuracy
   - Purchase flow validation

4. **Security Tests**:
   - Prevention of unauthorized token operations
   - Token validation mechanisms
   - Fraud detection controls

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example token system test
async def test_token_transaction_integrity():
    # Arrange
    user_id = "test_user_id"
    initial_balance = await get_user_token_balance(user_id)
    token_amount = 50
    
    # Act
    # Attempt concurrent transactions
    tasks = [
        deduct_tokens(user_id, token_amount, "test_transaction"),
        add_tokens(user_id, token_amount * 2, "test_transaction")
    ]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Assert
    final_balance = await get_user_token_balance(user_id)
    assert final_balance == initial_balance + token_amount
    
    # Verify transaction records
    transactions = await get_user_token_transactions(user_id)
    assert len(transactions) >= 2
    assert sum(t["amount"] for t in transactions) == token_amount
```
